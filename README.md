serval-meshetender
==================

my variations on the mesh-extender - right now there are two attempts

MeshPotato2: This is is tested and largely complete, but there is 
	an irritating kernel bug that ruins wireless performance. See
	The readme in the sub directory. Watch for a new subdirectory in /bin
	with a better kernel.  
 

WRT703n: This is an attempt to fit serval into 4m of flash without 
	an external filesystem. By trimming agressively, serval + os
	fits on flash. To use, flash with binary, and insert a USB
	Stick. It will format the stick& should "Just work".
